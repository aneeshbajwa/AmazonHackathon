# AmazonHackathon
Built federated learning based credit card detection model which can be trained on different servers(clents) while maintaining data privacy using two 
different API's - tensorflow_federated and Flower API
In AmazonHackathon.ipynb tesorflow_federated is used to create a federated learning api by creating four different clients and then training a neural network
model on them seprately.

Using Flower api a server.py and client.py files are created and federated learning is performed using them.
